In the Gregorian calendar, three criteria must be taken into account to identify leap years:
1. The year must be evenly divisible by 4;
2. If the year can also be evenly divided by 100, it is not a leap year; unless...
3. The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.

According to these rules, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, and 2500 are not the leap years.

This simple Python code checks the leap year with boolean logic and arithmetic operator algorithms.
